Q1. What is the MERN stack? Briefly describe the role of each technology.

Ans: The MERN stack is a set of four technologies used to build full web applications using JavaScript.
MongoDB stores the data, Express.js handles backend routes and logic
React.js builds the user interface, and Node.js runs the server.

--------------------------------------------

Q2. What is the difference between var, let, and const in JavaScript?

Ans: var is function-scoped and can be re-declared and updated.
let is block-scoped and can be updated but not re-declared in the same scope.
const is block-scoped and cannot be updated or re-declared — used for constants.

------------------------------------------

Q3. What are props in React? How are they different from state?

Ans: Props are inputs passed from one component to another in React — they are read-only.
State is local data managed inside a component — it can change over time.
Props are used to pass data, while state is used to store and manage data internally.

-------------------------------------------

Q4. What is JSX? How is it different from normal HTML?

Ans: JSX is a special syntax used in React that lets you write HTML-like code inside JavaScript.
It looks like HTML but works with JavaScript logic and expressions.
Unlike normal HTML, JSX needs things like className instead of class.
JSX makes it easier to build and manage user interfaces in React apps.

-------------------------------------------

Q5. What is the purpose of useState and useEffect in React?

Ans: useState => useState is used to create and manage a component’s data (state) that can change.
                 useState handles data, and useEffect handles side effects.

    useEffect=> useEffect is used to run code when the component mounts, updates, or unmounts (like API calls or timers).
                Together, they help React components be interactive and dynamic.

---------------------------------------------

Q6. What is npm? How do you use it to install a package in Node.js?

Ans: npm Node Package Manager is a tool to install and manage JavaScript packages in Node.js projects.
To install a package, use the command: npm install package-name.

---------------------------------------------

Q7. Explain what a REST API is and why it is useful in full-stack development.

Ans: A REST API (Representational State Transfer) is a way for the frontend and backend to communicate using HTTP requests.
It uses standard methods like GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE to perform actions on data.
Each request is made to a specific URL (endpoint) that represents a resource (like users or products).
REST APIs send and receive data in JSON format, which is easy to use with JavaScript.
They are useful in full-stack development because they connect the frontend (React) with the backend (Node/Nest) smoothly.

-----------------------------------------------

Q8. Write a JavaScript function to check if a number is even or odd.

Ans: (userNumber%2===0) => even
     or odd

------------------------------------------------

Q9.  What is the role of express.json() middleware in Express.js?

Ans: express.json() middleware is allows to enter json data in backend file

--------------------------------------------------

Q10. What is a component in React? Differentiate between class and function components.

Ans: A component in React is a reusable piece of UI, like a button, form, or card.
It helps break the UI into smaller parts that can be reused and managed easily.

functional => It’s a React component made using a simple function. It uses hooks like useState to keep data.
It’s easier and faster to write.

class => It’s a React component made using a class. It uses this.state to store data and has special methods for events.
It’s a bit longer and harder to write.

-------------------------------------------------------

Q11. How does map() work in JavaScript? Give one React example of its use in rendering a list.

Ans:  map() in JavaScript takes an array and creates a new array by applying a function to each item.

const fruits = ['Banana', 'Mango'];

function FruitList() {
  return (
    <ul>
      {fruits.map((fruit, index) => (
        <li key={index}>{fruit}</li>
      ))}
    </ul>
  );
}

Here, map() makes a list of <li> elements from the fruits array to display on the page.


----------------------------------------------------------

Q12.  Explain the folder structure of a basic React app created using create-react-app.

Ans: node_modules/ => contains all installed packages (auto-generated).
     public/ — static files like index.html, images, and icons.
     src/ — your main code folder where components, styles, and logic go.
     index.js — the entry point that renders the React app.
     App.js — the main app component where your UI starts.
     package.json — stores project info and dependencies.
     
-----------------------------------------------------------

Q13. What is the difference between GET and POST methods in Express APIs?

Ans: GET is used to fetch or get data from the server.
     POST is used to send or submit data to the server, usually to create or update something.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Q14. What is MongoDB? How is it different from a SQL database?

Ans: MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in BSON (binary JSON) format.
It is different from SQL databases because it is schema-less, meaning data can be stored in flexible, JSON-like documents instead of tables with fixed columns.
SQL databases use structured tables and predefined schemas, while MongoDB allows for more flexible and scalable data storage.

------------------------------------------------------------

Q15. What is the purpose of res.send() vs res.json() in Express?

Ans : res.send is send WebPage like doucment and Html formet.
      res.json is send json data Example :  {
                                              "name" : "fayyaz"
                                            }
